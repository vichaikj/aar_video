There is a greek proverb : "A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in". What are the greatest examples of this in human history ?
William Wilberforce.

He campaigned in the British Government for over 40 years to stop and prevent Slavery. He was successful in abolishing the Trading of Slaves throughout the Empire with the Slave Trade Act of 1807 and then the ownership of slaves altogether with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.

He died three days after hearing the Abolition Act had passed in Parliament, after a lifetime of campaigning for it. He is buried in Westminister Abbey which is reserved for monarchs and national figures of significance.

His campaign for Abolition was the blueprint that other abolitionists like Lincoln soon followed up with.

There are many generations living because of this man's choices.

Edit: and if his good karma wasn't already high enough, he was also a founding member of the Royal Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals RSPCA
